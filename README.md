<b> Experiment|     <b> Simulation for pre processing of 3D printed parts

### About the Experiment 

Pre-processing encompasses the steps between design and printing. Process of 3D printing starts with designing in CAD. Then printer software slices 3D CAD file into layers. For each slice, the software converts the data into machine code that determines tool paths for the machine to follow.

<h5> Target Audience : </h5>

Engineering students.
